# Ex Early Access Probability
## Lambda School - Data Science 9

Of the sixty-eight thousand games on Steam about four thousand of them are Early Access, and of those about six hundred have made it to a full release. With a success rate of only fifteen percent it doesn't seem too bright a concept, although, we don't know the success rate of those game which didn't try for a Traditional Release.

While there's a scarce few I've seen that actually made it I've also seen some that have turned out impressive like Hollow Knight or Warframe, and I'd like to have been able to know before hand if it had any chance of success. So...

**Is there a way to determine if an Early Access game is actually going to hit 1.0 or not?**

It's important to note that just because a game releases doesn't mean that it's a particularly good one; take Duke Nukem Forever for example. However, while quality is important to me we're not going to focus on that too much here, all we care about is what features increase or decrease the probability of a developer keeping their word.

So, is there anything concrete that determines a game's eventual release into 1.0? Let's find out.
